## What I work on

I build learning systems for dexterous manipulation and humanoid control, especially where morphology matters and deployment constraints are real.

## How I like to work

- Own the stack end-to-end (sim -> learning -> eval -> deployment)
- Build reproducible training pipelines and measurable ablations
- Keep notes and checklists so future experiments run faster

## Interests

- Morphology-conditioned control
- Sim-to-real and robustness
- Online learning / adaptation
- Systems for large-scale RL training
