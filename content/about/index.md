The bulk of my current research work is in discovering intelligence in robots, of which I am utilizing reinforcement learning, and continuing to explore supervised approaches such as that from the current trend of VLA's.

I do believe that there is a strong case for combining both approaches to achieve more generalizable and robust intelligence in embodied agents, whether through simulation or online learning methods.

Outside of research, I am actively involved as a leader in Triton Droids, where my goal is to build up opportunities for undergrads to get hands-on experience in embodied AI. You can check out the progress we have made here: https://triton-droids.vercel.app/
