Hello! I am a final year undergraduate at UC San Diego majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Math. My research interests are in embodied AI and robot learning, and I do some extracurricular robot building at Triton Droids.

If you are interested in collaborating or want to chat, feel free to reach out via email! Otherwise do check out some of my very early attempts at blog-post writing below.
